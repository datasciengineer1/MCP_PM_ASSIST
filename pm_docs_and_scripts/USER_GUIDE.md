# 🤖 PM Assistant MVP - User Guide

## Overview
The PM Assistant MVP is a **Multi-Agent Program Management system** that uses AI agents to analyze projects, create plans, assess risks, and generate documentation automatically.

## 🏠 **Main Dashboard** (`http://localhost:3002`)

### What You See:
- **📊 Quick Stats**: Overview of projects, agents, requirements, and risks
- **🤖 Multi-Agent System Status**: Shows all 5 AI agents and their current state
- **⚡ Quick Actions Panel**: Buttons to start common tasks
- **📈 Project Status Chart**: Visual breakdown of project statuses
- **📋 Recent Projects**: List of your latest projects

### What Each Quick Action Does:
1. **New Project** → Creates a new project (redirects to projects page)
2. **Upload Files** → Process Excel, JIRA, or text files for analysis
3. **Generate Docs** → Create requirements & specifications
4. **Run Multi-Agent Analysis** → Execute the complete AI pipeline

## 🤖 **Multi-Agent System** (`/agents`)

### The 5 AI Agents:
1. **📋 Input Parser Agent** (Blue) - Processes and analyzes input data
2. **📅 Planning Agent** (Green) - Creates project plans and timelines  
3. **⚠️ Risk Assessment Agent** (Red) - Identifies and categorizes risks
4. **📄 Documentation Agent** (Purple) - Generates requirements and specs
5. **⚙️ Orchestrator Agent** (Orange) - Coordinates workflows between agents

### How to Use the Multi-Agent System:

#### **Step 1: Select a Project**
- Use the **project dropdown** in the top-right corner
- If you don't have projects, create them first in the `/projects` page
- The system needs a project context to analyze

#### **Step 2: Run Full Analysis** (Recommended)
- Click the big **"Run Full Analysis"** button
- This executes all agents in sequence:
  1. Input Parser analyzes the project
  2. Planning Agent creates tasks and timeline  
  3. Risk Assessment identifies potential issues
  4. Documentation Agent generates requirements
- Watch the **Workflow Pipeline** show real-time progress
- Results appear in the **Execution Results** section below

#### **Step 3: Run Individual Agents** (Advanced)
- Click **"Run"** button on any individual agent card
- Useful for testing specific agent functions
- Watch the **Execution Log** for real-time feedback

### What Happens When You Run Analysis:
- **Database Updates**: Agents create tasks, risks, requirements automatically
- **Real-time Feedback**: Execution log shows progress and results
- **Visual Pipeline**: See which agent is running and their status
- **Detailed Results**: View what each agent accomplished

## 🚀 **Getting Started Workflow**

### **First Time Setup:**
1. **Visit Dashboard** → Get familiar with the interface
2. **Go to Projects** → Create your first project
3. **Return to Agents** → Select your project from dropdown  
4. **Run Full Analysis** → Let AI agents analyze your project
5. **Review Results** → Check generated tasks, risks, requirements
6. **Explore Other Pages** → See what the agents created

### **Daily Usage:**
1. **Upload new files** → Process new project documents
2. **Run targeted agents** → Update specific areas (risks, tasks, etc.)
3. **Review analytics** → Track project progress
4. **Refine requirements** → Adjust generated documentation

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Please select a project first"**
- Go to `/projects` page and create a project
- Return to `/agents` and select it from dropdown

### **"No projects available"**
- Database might be empty
- Run: `npm run db:seed` to create sample projects

### **Agent buttons not responding**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure project is selected
- Try refreshing the page

### **Workflow Pipeline stuck**
- Individual agent might have failed
- Check Execution Log for error messages
- Try running agents individually

---

## 📋 **Expected Results**

### **After Running Full Analysis:**
- **✅ 3-5 Tasks created** (Project Initialization, Requirements Analysis, etc.)
- **✅ 2-3 Risks identified** (Technical complexity, resource availability)  
- **✅ 2-3 Requirements generated** (User authentication, data security)
- **✅ 1 Document created** (Project Requirements Document)
- **✅ Execution log shows all steps completed**

### **Where to Find Results:**
- **Tasks**: Check `/tasks` page or database
- **Risks**: Check `/risks` page  
- **Requirements**: Check `/requirements` page
- **Documents**: Stored in database (view in settings/admin)

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **Real-time Execution**
- Live progress updates during agent runs
- Visual pipeline showing current step
- Detailed execution log with timestamps

### **Intelligent Coordination**  
- Orchestrator manages agent dependencies

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Start with sample projects** from the seed data
2. **Upload relevant documents** before running analysis  
3. **Run Full Analysis first**, then individual agents for refinement
4. **Check all result pages** to see what was generated
5. **Review execution logs** to understand what each agent did
6. **Re-run agents** as projects evolve and change
